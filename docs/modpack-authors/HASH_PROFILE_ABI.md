# Hash And Profile ABI

This document defines the compatibility contract for Lib modpack hashing and
profile storage.

If a change alters:

- how a module is identified
- how a persisted storage field is keyed
- how defaults are interpreted
- how a value is serialized

treat it as ABI work, not cleanup.

## Scope

Covered data:

- shared hashes created by `lib.modpack`
- coordinator profile slots stored in coordinator config
- discovered coordinated modules

For UI and live-module behavior, use [COORDINATOR_GUIDE.md](COORDINATOR_GUIDE.md).

## Canonical Format

Lib modpack encodes config state into a canonical key-value string:

```text
_v=3|ModuleId=1|ModuleId.alias=value
```

Properties:

- `_v` is the hash format version and must be present
- keys are sorted alphabetically before final serialization
- only non-default values are encoded
- unknown or malformed loose segments are ignored on decode when they do not
  target a known setting
- missing keys decode to current defaults
- keys and values are token-escaped before joining with `=` and `|`

`ModuleId=1` is the Lib-injected `Enabled` alias encoded as module enable
state. Lib modpack does not also emit `ModuleId.Enabled`.

The same string is used for:

- portable sharing
- local coordinator profile slots

### Token Escaping

The canonical string uses `=` between each key/value pair and `|` between
entries. Literal reserved characters inside keys or values are escaped before
serialization:

| Raw character | Encoded token |
| --- | --- |
| `%` | `%25` |
| `|` | `%7C` |
| `=` | `%3D` |

Encoding applies to token contents only. The envelope delimiters remain raw:

```text
ModuleId.Filter=Apollo%7CZeus%3DPoseidon%25Chaos
```

decodes to:

```text
ModuleId.Filter = Apollo|Zeus=Poseidon%Chaos
```

Always encode `%` before other reserved characters, and decode after splitting
the canonical string into entries. This keeps persisted string storage values
safe when they contain hash delimiters.

## Frozen ABI Surface

Treat the following as frozen after release unless you are doing deliberate
compatibility work:

- module `id`
- module `name` for user-facing module identity
- persisted storage root `alias`
- storage `default`
- storage type `toHash(...)`
- storage type `fromHash(...)`

These are the wire format.

## Why Each One Matters

### Module `id`

Module enable state is encoded under the module id.

Changing:

```lua
id = "OldName"
```

to:

```lua
id = "NewName"
```

moves the module into a new hash namespace.

### Module `name`

Lib requires every module to declare a display name. Lib modpack uses it for
module UI labels when `shortName` is absent and for diagnostics. Changing it
does not move hash keys, but it is still user-facing metadata and should be
treated as intentional UI compatibility work.

### Storage root `alias`

Storage values are encoded under:

```text
ModuleId.alias=value
```

`alias` is the hash key.

Lib also uses `alias` as the managed persistence key for ordinary storage roots.
Aliases are direct flat storage identifiers.

Only roots with `hash ~= false` participate in hash/profile serialization.

Exception: Lib injects `Enabled` as normal prepared storage, but Lib modpack
serializes it through the module-level `ModuleId=1` key so module enabled state
keeps the historical hash format. Lib-injected `DebugMode` has `hash = false`.

### `default`

Lib modpack only encodes non-default values.

Changing a default is a compatibility change even if the field name stays the
same.

### `toHash(...)` / `fromHash(...)`

Field type serialization is part of the wire format.

Changing:

- accepted strings
- normalization rules
- numeric formatting
- fallback behavior

can change how existing hashes decode or what future hashes look like.

Token escaping is also part of the wire envelope. Storage type codecs should
return their logical token value; Lib modpack owns escaping delimiters in the
outer key/value format.

## Decode Behavior

Lib modpack provides these decode guarantees:

- exact hash format version check on decode
- malformed loose segments are ignored
- unknown module namespaces are ignored
- unknown keys under known module namespaces are ignored during apply
- missing keys fall back to defaults
- invalid module enable tokens fail the import and roll back
- invalid scalar/table storage tokens for known storage roots fail the import
  and roll back
- saved coordinator profiles are audited at `Modpack.createPack(...)` and warn
  on unknown field keys inside known module namespaces

Module authors own compatibility plans for:

- renamed module ids
- renamed aliases
- changed defaults
- changed encoding semantics

## Shipped-Module Invariants

Once a module is publicly shipped, the following are part of its ABI and should
be treated as stable:

- module `id` - identifies the module in hashes and profiles
- persisted storage root `alias` names - identify values within a module's
  namespace
- storage defaults - consumed when a persisted value is absent

Changing any of these is a compatibility event and requires an explicit
compatibility plan.
